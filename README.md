## Project Summary

This project automates the provisioning of a **custom AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** using Terraform, ensuring a scalable, secure, and highly available network architecture for the **MS Cleaning Service**. By eliminating manual intervention, this setup enables efficient resource management while maintaining flexibility for future expansions. The infrastructure is built around a **VPC with DNS support**, allowing seamless internal name resolution. Public and private subnets are provisioned across three availability zones (`eu-west-2a`, `eu-west-2b`, and `eu-west-2c`) to enhance fault tolerance and high availability. Each public subnet is configured to map public IP addresses upon instance launch, ensuring accessibility for internet-facing workloads. Connectivity is established through an **Internet Gateway (IGW)**, which allows resources within the public subnets to communicate externally. A dedicated **public route table** is created and associated with all public subnets, directing outbound traffic through the IGW. Similarly, private subnets are isolated with a **private route table**, ensuring internal communication while preventing direct exposure to the internet. Security considerations are integrated through **network segmentation**, where private subnets remain shielded while public-facing applications operate within designated subnets. This setup allows for better **resource isolation**, minimizing potential attack vectors while maintaining accessibility for necessary operations. Terraform scripts orchestrate the entire deployment, ensuring consistency and easy modification as infrastructure needs evolve. This **automated provisioning model** optimizes scalability, reduces manual configuration errors, and streamlines network resource allocation for long-term efficiency.

## The Implementation Steps are summarised below:

1️⃣ ### **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed:

  - **Terraform CLI** → [Download Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)

  - **AWS CLI** → [Download AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

  - **Valid AWS Credentials** (`aws configure`)


## **2️⃣ Define Terraform Configuration Files**

## **3️⃣ Create a VPC**

## **4️⃣ Provision Subnets**

## **5️⃣ Create an Internet Gateway & Route Table**

## **6️⃣ Associate Subnets with Route Table**

## **7️⃣ Deploy Security Groups**

## **8️⃣ Initialize & Apply Terraform**

## **9️⃣ Verify Deployment**

## **🔹 Conclusion**

  ## **🔹 Why Automate VPC Creation?**

Overall, the **Automation of the provisioning of custom-built VPC with Terraform ensures consistency, scalability, and efficient and faster infrastructure deployment.**
